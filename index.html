            <p>Growing up, my dad worked for the railroad and served in the military. He was a hard worker and an excellent provider who set a great example for me. 
                I learned to do a good job not because I’m getting paid but because the quality of one’s work is a reflection on not just oneself but also one’s family. 
                A man with a poor work ethic is a poor man indeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am proud to carry on the work ethic my family is known for, I am not interested in sacrificing my health to do so. 
                My family has a history of working themselves to death. My father still works a very physically demanding job with three bulged disks in his back. 
                Whether it be from pain or because he is working the night shift, he doesn’t have time to be with his family like he should.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I worked my twelve-hour night shift at the factory, I realized that if I didn’t make a change, I would end up repeating my father’s mistakes.
                It’s this desire to provide a better home life for my family that has led me to acquire the skills to work as a data analyst. 
                These are the things that drive me to achieve.
